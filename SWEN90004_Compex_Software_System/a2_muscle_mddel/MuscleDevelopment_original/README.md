# Muscle Fiber Simulation
bichuan liu
## Introduction
This project simulates the behavior of muscle fibers, consisting of three main classes: `MuscleFiber`, `Patch`, and `Simulation`. Through the interaction of these classes, we can simulate the response and behavior of muscle fibers under different conditions.

## File Descriptions
- `MuscleFiber.java`: Defines the properties and behaviors of a muscle fiber.
- `Patch.java`: Represents a segment of the muscle fiber, containing related physical properties and methods.
- `Simulation.java`: Manages the entire simulation process, coordinating different instances of `MuscleFiber` and `Patch`.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. Place all Java files in the same directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files.
4. Compile all Java files:
   ```bash
   javac Simulation.java
   ```
5. Run the simulation
```bash
java Simulation.class
```
Besides this, runing the main function in Simulation.java in IDE can work as well.
